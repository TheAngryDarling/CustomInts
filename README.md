This kit adds additional integers with custom sizes.  They are as follows:
24 bit ints: Int24, UInt24
40 bit ints: Int40, UInt40
48 bit ints: Int48, UInt48
56 bit ints: Int56, UInt56

Reasoning behind these custom types are when you need to read file formats that require one or more of these int sizes

## Usage
You can use thes custom integer types like you would any other integer type
